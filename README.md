# OrthoMCL_Results_Processing
This python program will take the orthomcl output (groups, proteomes and singletons) and produce different human readable results

# Dependencies
pyvenn (already available in this repo as venn_l, original reference: https://github.com/tctianchi/pyvenn)
matplotlib 3.3.4 (Required) -> Generate Venn diagrams
Spacy 3.0.3 (Optionnal, use --ignore_spacy flag to skip) -> Regroup similar protein function annotation according to their textual similarity
en_core_web_lg dictionnary for Spacy -> Gives best results during testing

# Usage:

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  
  -g GROUP_FILE, --group GROUP_FILE
                        Group file containing proteins groups [REQUIRED]
                        
  -s SINGLETONS_FILE, --singleton SINGLETONS_FILE
                        Singleton file containing single proteins [OPTIONAL]
                        
  -p PROTEOME_FILE, --proteome PROTEOME_FILE
                        Fasta file regrouping all proteomes (MUST INCLUDE
                        PROTEIN ANNOTATION AND ID MUST BE SEPERATE BY A SPACE)
                        [OPTIONAL]
                        
  -c SPC_LIST, --species SPC_LIST
                        Species tag list (ex: TBE,COVI,...) [REQUIRED]
                        
  -r REGROUP_LIST, --regroup REGROUP_LIST
                        List of species you want to regroup (; to link ,to
                        seperate) SP1;SP2,SP3;SP4 means 1 regroup with SP1 and
                        SP2 and 1 regroup with SP3 and SP4 [OPTIONAL]
                        
  -l TABLE_LIMIT, --limit TABLE_LIMIT
                        Ortho Table limit for cluster count (every cluster >=
                        this value will have their count add to the same value
                        (Val+)) ! higher value means more columns in the table
                        ! [DEFAULT=11]
                        
  --venn_dpi DPI        Pixel Density for Venn Diagram greater value means
                        sharper but bigger png [DEFAULT=400]
                        
  --ignore_spacy        Ignore Spacy step to reduce annotation count (remove
                        spacy dependency, MUCH faster, but will produce a
                        massive annotation CSV)
                        
  --spacy_simthres SPACY_THRES
                        Similarity threshold for spacy annotation regrouping
                        MODIFY AT YOUR OWN RISK [DEFAULT=0.95]
                        
  --spacy_pipeline SPACY_PIPE
                        Spacy language pipeline to use (all the developpement was
                        done with en_core_web_lg, so it's not recommended to
                        use another) [default=en_core_web_lg]
                        
  -o OUTPUT_FOLDER, --output OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Output folder name [Default=orthomcl_resgen_out/]
                        
                        
 # Input file
 
This program takes the OrthoMCL output files (singletons.txt and groups.txt) as is. The proteomes file must be generated by the user (a simple cat *.fasta > proteomes.fasta will do the trick) DO NOT USE THE COMPLIANT FASTA SEQUENCE GENERATED BY ORTHOMCL, it must be the original proteome files
 
All the proteomes must contain a unique sequence identifier AND a protein function annotation
 
The singletons file can be ommited if you don't want to include the singletons in your results
